Day 5 - For Loops, Range and Code Blocks

048 - Day 5 Goals
At he end of the day we should be able to make a password generator

049 - For Loop

Loops
A loop is something that is supposed to happen over and over again

For Loop
A for loop is a control flow statement used in programming to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specific number of iterations or while traversing a collection

for item in list_of_items:
    #Do something for each item

fruits = ["Apple","Peach","Pear" ]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")

output - Apple
         Apple Pie
         Peach
         Peach Pie
         Pear
         Pear Pie

What the code is doing is taking this list of fruits and it's assigning a variable name to each of them
So the first time this runs fruit = Apple
The second time fruit = Peach
The third time fruit = Pear

050 - Interactive Assignment 1
#Average Height Exercise
You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

e.g student_heights = [180,124,165,173,189,169,146]

The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights

#Don't change the code below
student_heights = input("Input a list of student heights").split()

for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n])
print(student_heights)
#Don't change the code below

#Write your code below

#Solution
Check 050-interactivetest1.py for solution

051 - Interactive Assignment 2
#Highest Score
You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a list of scores

75 65 89 55 91 64 89

e.g students_score = [75,65,89,55,91,64,89]
output - The highest score in the class is: x

#Don't change the code below
student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores: ")
for n in range(0,len(student_scores)):
    student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
#Don't change the code above

#Write your code below this row


#Solution
Check 051-interactivetest2.py for solution

052 - For Loops and the range function
Using for loops with the range function
range(start,stop,[step])
for number in range(a,b)
    print(number)

for number in range(1, 10):
    print(number)

output - 1
         2
         3
         4
         5
         6
         7
         8
         9

Range starts from the first number and lists but does not include the last number

Getting the sum for every number from 1 to 100
total = 0
for number in range(1,101):
    total += number

print(total)

053 - Interactive Assignment 3
#Adding Evens
You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100,including 1 and 100

e.g 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + ... + 98 + 100

#Solution
Check 053-interactivetest3.py for solution

054 - Interactive Assignment 4
#FizzBuzz

You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
    Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
    When the number is divisble by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print Fizz

    When the number is divisble by 5 then instead of printing the number it should print FizzBuzz

    And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

#Solution
Check 054-interactivetest4.py for solution

055 - Final Project
#Password generator
Build a program that ask the user for the number of letters,numbers and symboles they want in the password and
generate it for them

#Don't touch the code below
import random
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'O', 'P', 'Q', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'U', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z']
numbers = ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
symbols = ['!', '#', '$', '%', '&', '(', ')', '*', '+']

print("Welcome to the PyPassword Generator!")
nr_letters= int(input("How many letters would you like in your password?\n"))
nr_symbols = int(input(f"How many symbols would you like?\n"))
nr_numbers = int(input(f"How many numbers would you like?\n"))
#Don't touch the code above

#Write your code below

#Solution
Check 055-passwordgen.py for the solution

056 - Congratulations
You have completed day 5
Yay
