Day 5 - For Loops, Range and Code Blocks

048 - Day 5 Goals
At he end of the day we should be able to make a password generator

049 - For Loop

Loops
A loop is something that is supposed to happen over and over again

For Loop
A for loop is a control flow statement used in programming to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specific number of iterations or while traversing a collection

for item in list_of_items:
    #Do something for each item

fruits = ["Apple","Peach","Pear" ]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    print(fruit + " Pie")

output - Apple
         Apple Pie
         Peach
         Peach Pie
         Pear
         Pear Pie

What the code is doing is taking this list of fruits and it's assigning a variable name to each of them
So the first time this runs fruit = Apple
The second time fruit = Peach
The third time fruit = Pear
