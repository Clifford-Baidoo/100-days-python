#Welcome to day 3
Day 3 - Conditional Statements,Logical Operators,Code Blocks and Scope

027-Day 3 Goals
At the end of the day we should be able to build a choose  your adventure game

028 - Control Flow
With IF - ELSE and Conditional Operators
Conditional operators are operators that execute particular objectives depending on a particular Conditional

Conditional(IF/ELSE)
Depending on a particular condition we would do either A or B
if condition:
    do this
else:
    do this

Example
water_level = 50
if water_level > 80:
    print("Drain Water")
else:
    print("Continue")

#A program that uses if/else condition to do the work
#of a ticket box
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height > 120: #required height for rollercoaster
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster") #indentation matters leave a required space
else:
    print("Sorry, you have to grow taller before you can ride")

Comparison Operators
Operators that are used to compare between two or more values

Operator          Meaning
   >            Greater than
   <            Less than
   >=           Greater than or equal to
   <=           Less than or equal to
   ==           equal to
   !=           not equal to

Modulo Operation
The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python.It gives you the remainder after a division.

6 % 2 = 0
7 % 2 = 1
becaue when 7 is put into 2s = 2 + 2 + 2 + 1(remainder)

029 - Interactive Assignment 1
#Odd or Even
Write a program that works out whether if a given number
is an odd or even number

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder
e.g. 86  is even because 86 / 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places.Therefore the divison is clean
e.g. 59 is odd because 59 / 2 = 36.875

# Don't change the code below
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check?"))
#Don't change the code above

#Write your code below this line
#Check 029-Interactivetest1.py for the solution

030 - Nested if Statements and Elif Statements
These Statements are used to check conditions if they are more than 2 conditions to check

Nested if - Used to check a condition after the first if has been passed

if condition:
    if another condition:
        do this
    else:
        do this
else:
    do this

print("Welcome to the rollercoaster")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoastere!")
    if age <= 18:
        print("Please pay $7.")
    else:
        print("Please pay $12.")
else:
    print("Sorry,you have to grow taller before you can ride.")

if / elif / else - Used to check another condition after the first failed for 2 or more times

if condition1:
    do A
elif condition2:
    do B
else:
    do this

print("Welcome to the rollercoaster")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoastere!")
    if age < 12:
        print("Please pay $5.")
    elif 12 > age < 18:
        print("Please pay $7.")
    else:
        print("Please pay $12.")
else:
    print("Sorry,you have to grow taller before you can ride.")

031 - Interactive Assignment 2
Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value

1. Under 18.5 they are underweight
2. Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
3. Over 25 but below 30 they are overweight
4. Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
5. Above 35 they are clinically obese

#Don't change the code below
height = float(input("Enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("Enter your weight in kg: "))
#Don't change code above

#Write your code below
#Check 031-Interactivetest2.py for solution

032 - Interactive Assignment 3
Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a
leap year. A normal leap year has 366 days, with an extra
day in February.

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year

on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

e.g The year 2000            e.g The year 2100
2000 / 4 = 500 (Leap)        2100 / 4 = 525 (Leap)
2000 / 100 = 20 (Not Leap)   2100 / 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
2000 / 400 = 5 (Leap)        2100 / 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
So 2000 is a Leap year       So 2100 is not a Leap year

#Don't Change the Code Below
year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? \n"))
#Don't Change the Code Above

#Write your code below this line
#Solution
Check 032-Interactivetest3.py for solution

033 - Multiple If Statements in Succession
Multiple if Statements check whether all the if Statements are true instead of checking just one if and leaving the others

if condition1:
    do A
if condition2:
    do B
if condition3:
    do C

In this example we will ask the user if they want a photo with their ticket and if they say yes we add 3 dollars to
their bill

print("Welcome to the rollercoaster")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))
age = int(input("What is your age? "))
bill = 0

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoastere!")
    if age < 12:
        bill = 5
        print("Children tickets are $5.")
    elif 12 > age < 18:
        bill = 7
        print("Youth tickets are $7.")
    else:
        bill = 12
        print("Adult tickets are $12.")

    wants_photo = input("Do you want a photo taken? Y or N . \n")
    if wants_photo = "Y":
        bill += 3

    print(f"Your final bill is {bill}")

else:
    print("Sorry,you have to grow taller before you can ride.")

034 - Interactive Assignment 4
#Pizza Order Exercise
Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza.Your first
job is to build an automatic pizza order program

Based on a user's order, work out their final bill
Small Pizza: $15
Medium Pizza: $20
Large Pizza: $25

Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3

Extra cheese for any size pizza: +$1

#Don't change the code below
print("Welcome to Python Pizza Deliveries")
size = input("What size pizza do you want? S, M, or L ")
add_pepperoni = input("Do you want pepperoni? Y or N ")
extra_cheese = input("Do you want extra chees? Y or N ")
#Don't change the code above

#Write your code below this line

035 - Logical Operators
These operators help check for multiple conditions in the same line of code

1.and
2.or
3.not

A and B - Both have to be true
a = 12
a > 15              a > 10
    output - False      output - True

a > 10 and a < 13
True since a which is 12 is greater than 10 and less than 13
a > 10 and a > 13
output - False

C or D - One has to be true

not E - Reverses a condition
a = 12
not a > 15
output - True

Using Logical operators we are going to add a new category to the rollercoaster business
for people between the ages og 45 - 55 for $0

036 - Ineractive assignment
#Love Calculator
You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
We're going to use the super scientific method recommemded by BuzzFeed.

To work out the love score between two people:
    Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters
    in the word TRUE occurs.Then check for the number of times the letters
    in the word LOVE occurs.Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
    "Your score is x,you go together like coke and mentos."

For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
    "Your score is y, you are alright together"

Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
    "Your score is z"

Hint
1.The lower() function changes all the letters in a string to lower case
2.The count() function will give you the number of times a letter occurs in a string

# Don't change the code below
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")
name1 = input("What is your name? \n")
name2 = input("What is their name? \n")
#Don't change the code above

#Write your code below the line
