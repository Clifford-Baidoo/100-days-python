Daay 2 - Data Types,Numbers,Operations,Type Conversion,f-strings

017 -Todays Project
     After the day we will be able to build a "Tip Calculator Program"
    It splits the bill between a group of people and also calculates the tip to be added

#Welcome to the tip Calculator
#What was the total bill?
#How many people to split the bill?

018 - Python Primitive Data Types

DATA TYPES - Data types are classifications of various types of data that tell the interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

1.String
    A string represents a sequence of characters
    "Hello" , "Kofi" , "Kwesi"
    print("Hello")

    Subscripting - Pulling a particular character from a string
    done by adding [] and putting the index of the character you want
    print("Hello"[0]) - Output = H
    (Programmers start counting from 0 so the first character will be 0)
    print("Hello"[4]) - Output = o

    As long as a character is in a double quote it is a string
    Example - "123" = This is a string
    print("123"+"345")
    output - 12345

2.Integer (int)
    Integers are whole numbers whether negative or positive
    12 , 14 , -15

    print(123 + 345)
    output - 468
3.Float Point Number (Float)
    Floats are numbers that have a decimal place or point
    3.12 , 45.3

    print(3.12)
    output - 3.12

4.Boolean (bool)
    Boolean represents values True or False
    Both True and False have to begin with a capital letter

    print(5>3)
    output - True

    print(3>5)
    output - False

019-Type Error,Type Checking and Type Conversion
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific type

the len() function is used to return length (number of items) of an object.
len("Hello")
    output-5

len(4837)
    output - Type Error
    because len doesn't support integers

Type Error
A Type Error in python occurs when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate data type.

num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))
print("Your name has" + num_char + "characters.")
    output - TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int ") to str

we were concatenating a string to an integer which is not allowed

type() function - Shows the data type you are working with

num_char = len(input("What is your name?"))
print(type(num_char))
    output - <class 'int'>

when working with a data type and you are not sure of what you are working with you can use the type() function to check it

Type Conversion
Changing a piece of data from one data type to another

num_char = len(input("What is your name?")) - This is an integer and by using the function str() we will change it to a string
new_num_char = str(num_char)
print("Your name has" + new_num_char + "characters.")
    output - Your name has 6 characters

Other Conversion examples
a = 123
print(type(a)) - output = <class 'int'>

a = str(123)
a = float(123)

print(70 + float("100.5"))
    the string "100.5" is converted to a float and is added to 70
    output - 170

020 - Interactive Assignment 1
#Write a program that adds in a 2 digit number e.g if the input was 35,
#then the output should be 3+5 = 8

#solution
number = input("Enter your 2 digit number:\n")
num1 = int(number[0])
num2 = int(number[1])
sum = num1 + num2
print(sum)
#Check the actual code for a full explanation

021 - Mathematical Operations
Mathematical operations in Python allow you to perform arithmetic computations.

Operators
3 + 5 - Addition
7 - 4 - Subtraction
3 * 2 - Multiplication
6 / 3 - Division
2 ** 2 - Exponent

Python uses PEMDAS to priotize operators in one line
Parentheses ()
Exponents **
Multiplication *
Division /
Addition +
Subtraction -
Calculation that is most to the left is priotized

print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 -3)
output - 7

print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)
output - 3

022 - Interactive Assignment 2
#BMI Calculator Exercise
#Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index(BMI) from a
#users weight and height
#BMI = weight(kg)/height**2(m**2)

#Check the code for solution

023 - Number Manipulation and F Strings
Round() function
used to round off numbers or floats
print(round(8/3))
adding , [number] allows it to run it off to the number of decimal places
print(round(8/3,2)) - Rounds it off to two decimal places
print(round(2.666666,2))

Floor division
Turns the output to an integer instead of a float
Instead of using just one / you use //
print(8//3)
    output 2
print(type(8//3))
    output <class 'int'>

Continue performing calculations on a variable
result = 4 / 2
result /= 2
print(result)
    output - 1

score = 0
#user scores a point
score += 1
print(score)
    output - 1

#user loses a point
score -= 1
print(score)
    output - -1
[operator]= adds,divides,substracts or multiplies another value to the variable that has already been calculated

Fstrings
f-strings (formatted string literals) in Python are a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces {}

score = 0
height = 1.8
isWinning = True

normally if we concatenate it won't work because they are different data types and we will get a type error

to use you add a f infront of your string and put other data types infront of other data types
print(f"your score is {score},your height is {height}, you are winning is {isWinning}")


024 - Interactive Assignment 3
#Life In Weeks
#Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many,days,weeks,
#months we have left if we live until 90 years old
#It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#|You have x days,y weeks and z months left
#where x,y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

#Solution
Solution is in 024-Interactivetest3.py so check it out


025 - DAY2-Project TIP Calculator
#Create a program that accepts the total bill , ask for the percentage of tip you want to give
#ask the number of people who want to split the bill and gives an amount that each person should pay

#Output
Welcome to the tip calculator
What was the total bill? [User Input]
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 , 12 or 15? [User Input]
How many people to split the bill? [User Input]
Each person should pay: [Amount Calculated]

#Solution
Check 025-tipcalculator.py for answer

026- You are already in the top 50
You can do it
Keep going
rest small
see you tomorrow lads
